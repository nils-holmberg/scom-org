## user engagment and sentiment measures
line of argument ..
- user engagment is an important ngo organizational outcome, kpi
- sentiment measures positively associated with user engagement [../fig/ei-sa-norm-01.png](../fig/ei-sa-norm-01.png)
- time drives both user engagement and sentiment measures
- controlling for follower count takes away positive effect of time
- sentiment measures positively associated with relative engagement ? ()
- number of posts over time
- two relative measures: 
    - engagement relative to sentiment
    - engagement relative to followers
- relative engagement over time
- maybe need for a sentiment index ? e.g. s_index = frq + int
